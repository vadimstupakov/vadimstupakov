### Hi there, I am Vadim Stupakov ðŸ‘‹  

My interest in working with big data and my desire for high-quality and detailed analysis became a motivation for me to pursue a career in IT. To achieve my goal, I took a course in Data Analysis at Yandex.Praktikum. Starting with print "Hello world!" I learned how to do massive research with various visualizations, hypothesis tests, and based on that draw conclusions and make recommendations. You can read more about this in my [portfolio](https://github.com/vadimstupakov/yandex_practicum)
